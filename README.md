To use this extension:
First, download sbDuelingClient as a .zip, then extract the zip file.
On a Chromium-based web browser (sorry Firefox), go to your extension settings, and enable developer mode.
You should see an option to load an unpacked extension. You can either select the sbDuelingClient folder (the one that directly contains the manifest.json file), or the manifest.json file.
This mod will only work in modded games. Unfortantely, modded games invoked with the create custom game button on the home page will not currently work.
